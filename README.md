# PiBot

Code worked on with my nephew for a experiment to build a Raspberry Pi based robot

## Setting up the Raspberry-Pi

For a new Raspberry Pi, or a new OS install, we need to install some applications and
libraries.

### Operating system packages

Run the following in the console:

```
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-dev
```

### Python libraries

Run the following in the console:

```
sudo pip install RPi.GPIO
```

## Run the program from console

```
python3 robot.py
```
